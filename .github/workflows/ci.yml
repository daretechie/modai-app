      # Further steps for deployment to Kubernetes would go here.
      # This would typically involve setting up Kubeconfig and then running helm upgrade.
      # Example (requires KUBECONFIG secret and proper permissions):
      # - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
      #   run: helm upgrade --install my-release helm/ --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig
